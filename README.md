# astronomR: Astronomy and Cosmology Analysis in R ðŸŒŒâœ¨

An R package designed to bridge the gap between data science and the cosmos!

## Why {astronomR}?

While R is widely used in data science and statistical computing, there has been a lack of tools specifically tailored for astronomical data. {astronomR} aims to fill this gap, offering easy-to-use functions and tools for anyone looking to explore space and cosmology through data. Whether youâ€™re an astrophysicist or just a data enthusiast, {astronomR} is here to help you navigate the universe.

## Installing this Package

``` r
# Install devtools package if you don't have it
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("samrit2442/astronomR")
```

## Introduction

This package was developed for astronomy, cosmological computation, and analysis with R.
The source code can be found here https://github.com/samrit2442/astronomR.git

## Some Usage and Example Codes
Normally in astronomy, we use a different sort of angular system for location. We can easily do that in our package. Letâ€™s see how. Suppose, we have an angular value of `d = 177.74208Â°` We want to convert it into an hour-minute-second. There is a very simple function.
``` r
deg_to_hms(177.74208)
#> 11H50M58.0992S
hms_to_deg(11, 50, 58.09925)
#> [1] 177.7421
```
What else can be done? Letâ€™s say we want to find the path of some star in a particular location for a time interval. This can also be done using our package.

To do that, first, we need to define the RA and Dec value of the star. Letâ€™s see to do this. Also, letâ€™s define the time of observation and its location.

``` r
ra_hour <- 16.695  # RA in hours
dec_deg <- 36.466667  # Dec in degrees
lat_obs <- 52.5  # Observer's latitude
lon_obs <- -1.9166667  # Observer's longitude
datetime <- as.POSIXct("1998-08-10 23:10:00", tz = "UT")  # Observation time
```
Now, create the star location as seen from that location on the time mentioned. This returns Altitude and Azimuth as normally used.
``` r
star_location <- RA_dec2Alt_azi(ra_hour, dec_deg, lat_obs, lon_obs, datetime)
print(paste("Altitude:", star_location$altitude, "degrees"))
#> [1] "Altitude: 49.1688687197424 degrees"

print(paste("Azimuth:", star_location$azimuth, "degrees"))
#> [1] "Azimuth: 269.146669462321 degrees"
```
This tells us from some location, what is the position of the star so that we can use a telescope to watch it!
Using this simple function, we can trace out the path any star travels.
Letâ€™s see how and also maybe plot it.
For that, letâ€™s first make a time range, for which we want to see the location.
``` r
# Plotting Rigel's Motion
start_datetime <- as.POSIXct("2024-10-02 00:00:00", tz = "UTC")
end_datetime <- as.POSIXct("2024-10-03 00:00:00", tz = "UTC")

# Generate timestamps at 20-minute intervals
timestamps <- seq(from = start_datetime, to = end_datetime, by = "20 mins")
altitude <- numeric(length(timestamps))
azimuth <- numeric(length(timestamps))

observer_lat <- 43.1566  # Latitude in degrees
observer_lon <- -77.6088  # Longitude in degrees

# RA and Dec for Rigel (converted RA to hours)
rigel_ra <- 78.634467 / 15  # RA in hours
rigel_dec <- -8.20164  # Dec in degrees

# Calculate altitude and azimuth for each timestamp
for (i in seq_along(timestamps)) {
  datetime <- timestamps[i]
  result <- RA_dec2Alt_azi(rigel_ra, rigel_dec, observer_lat, observer_lon, datetime)
  altitude[i] <- result$altitude
  azimuth[i] <- result$azimuth
}

# Create a data frame with results
rigel_positions <- data.frame(datetime = timestamps, altitude = altitude, azimuth = azimuth)

# 2D Plot for Altitude over Time
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(rigel_positions, aes(x = datetime, y = altitude)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Time", y = "Altitude (degrees)", title = "Altitude of Rigel over 24 hours")
```

## Gaia Data Archive
The **Gaia Data Archive** is a comprehensive database that houses the data collected by the European Space Agencyâ€™s Gaia mission. Launched in December 2013, Gaia is designed to create the most accurate three-dimensional map of the Milky Way galaxy by observing and cataloguing the positions, distances, and motions of over a billion stars.
In Python **Astropy** and **Astroquery** is used to import data directly. We can do the same thing in our package. Letâ€™s see how:
``` r
df <- get_gaia_data(vars = "ra, dec, parallax", condition = "parallax > 50")
head(df)

#>         ra       dec  parallax
#> 1 316.7537  38.75607 286.00534
#> 2 316.7485  38.76386 285.99493
#> 3 298.4819  44.41291 214.57451
#> 4 249.3875 -53.69952  53.22840
#> 5 243.4453 -57.57679  73.54824
#> 6 312.2788  37.47123  56.86465
```
Nice! Isnâ€™t it?
Letâ€™s use this for some analysis. Why not create an H-R diagram.

For this first, letâ€™s convert parallax to absolute magnitude.

``` r
library(dplyr)
calculate_absolute_magnitude <- function(parallax, g_mag) {
  distance_pc <- 1 / (parallax / 1000)
  abs_mag <- g_mag - 5 * (log10(distance_pc) - 1)
  return(abs_mag)
}

# Let's import the data
df <- get_gaia_data(vars = "ra, dec, parallax, phot_g_mean_mag, phot_bp_mean_mag, phot_rp_mean_mag", 
                    condition = "parallax > 50")
#data processing
df <- df %>%
  mutate(color_index = phot_bp_mean_mag - phot_rp_mean_mag,
         abs_mag = calculate_absolute_magnitude(parallax, phot_g_mean_mag))
# Filter out any rows with NA values
df <- df %>% filter(!is.na(color_index), !is.na(abs_mag))

# Plot an H-R diagram
ggplot(df, aes(x = color_index, y = abs_mag)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Color Index (G_BP - G_RP)", y = "Absolute Magnitude (M)", 
       title = "Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_reverse()  # Reverse the y-axis for magnitude
```

## Cosmological Calculation
We can do many things related to cosmology using this. Letâ€™s see a few of them. Before that, I will suggest to run this code.
As we know, there are many cosmological models. You can define these in our package.
``` r
cosmo <- FlatLCDM(0.6774, 0.6911, 0.3089, 8.4e-5)
cosmo
#> $hubble_constant_fact
#> [1] 0.6774
#> 
#> $dark_matter_crit
#> [1] 0.69110000000000005
#> 
#> $matter_crit
#> [1] 0.30890000000000001
#> 
#> $radiation_crit
#> [1] 8.3999999999999995e-05
#> 
#> $type
#> [1] "FlatLCDM"
#> 
#> $h_per_s
#> [1] 2.1949477836373805e-20
```
Now, we can directly use these models and inputs of other functions.
As we know scale factor of our universe `a = 1` today. We can directly use our function to calculate time at any given `a` value.
``` r
t_as_func_a_in_Year(cosmo, 1) # in year
#> [1] 13808979942.748983
```
We can find the age of our universe using this or use the function `age_of_universe_GY()`.
``` r
age_of_universe_GY(cosmo) # our universe age !!!!!
#> [1] 13.808979942748984
```
Our package can find the radius of curvature of our universe. Letâ€™s see:
```r
radius_of_curvature(cosmo)
#> [1] 0
```

Many more functions are coming soon. Wait for the documentation for more!
